## About Me

I'm Mirko, a passionate developer with proficiency in JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, and EJS. I have a strong command over the Node.js tech stack, including MongoDB as the database and Express.js. I occasionally enjoy programming Discord bots for fun. My latest creation is a verified bot named KOPED, which is currently offline and being re-written as time permits.

I'm also the creator of Sniplink, a link shortener that you can find at [sniplink.xyz](https://sniplink.xyz).

If you're interested in private commissions for Discord Bots or websites, feel free to message me on Discord at `iialanii`. Alternatively, if you'd like to get to know me better, you can also reach out to me on Discord.

I aspire to broaden my knowledge by exploring more programming languages and building larger, impactful programs for the world to see.

## My Discord JS Projects

Currently, my main project is KOPED, a semi-multipurpose bot that is currently being re-written. Additionally, I'm also working on a SnipLink.xyz Discord bot. This bot will make it easier for people to shorten links with SnipLink.xyz services right inside Discord.
