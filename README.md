 Hey ðŸ‘‹
 How's it going. I'm Mirko. I am a young man that has experience in HTML5(html, css and js), and Javascript.
 I sometimes now program Discord bots for the fun of it. My latest Discord bot, is a verified bot named KOPED - A semi-multipurpose Discord Bot.
 My other bots are Grooves Music 1 and Grooves Music 2 which didn't get approved my Discord.
 If you're interested, I could do private jobs for Discord Bots. Hit me up on my Discord [ Mirko#5255 ] and I'll see what i can do.
 
 Maybe one day I would have the energy to explore and learn more langauges and build bigger programs for the world to see.
```
  
  ## My Discord JS Projects

```console
I only have 3 Discord bots. (Only one of them being in service). That is KOPED. Like I mentioned above it is a semi-multipurpose bot.
Grooves Music 1 and 2 were both music bot (as the name suggests.) Though Grooves Music 2 being slightly faster then 1 because of how different the bot was made.
Maybe I'll work on a different Discord bot later.
```
